<v ->Normally when we order</v>

00:00:00.923 --> 00:00:02.100
chicken tikka masala, bing
(cash register chimes)

3
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.660
but we don't worry about it 'cause it's tastes good.

4
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.890
But you can have it possibly better

5
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.651
for this that is much cheaper.

00:00:06.651 --> 00:00:08.238
(upbeat electronic music)

7
00:00:08.238 --> 00:00:10.906
(slots jingle)

8
00:00:10.906 --> 00:00:13.406
(coins clink)

9
00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:26.762
So I've been feeling
(gentle piano music)

10
00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:27.900
this is gonna be a bit of a challenge,

11
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.510
because this is a heavy spice recipe,

12
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.770
and spices kind of jack

13
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.603
up the price of things.
(money sack thumps)

14
00:00:32.603 --> 00:00:34.290
So not everybody has a spice on hands,

15
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.130
they gotta go buy one,

16
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.470
and then we're gonna factor in the whole bottle, ow.

17
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.820
So we're gonna have to delete spices

18
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.840
and somehow configure

19
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.400
and mechanize this
(equations bleep)

20
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.950
into a fully functioning robot of flavor.

21
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.290
I don't know why I'm using mechanization

22
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.180
and robotics to describe this,

23
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.140
but I know that we can do it.

24
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.460
We've never backed down from a challenge.

25
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.070
So with all that being said, let's make this, shall we?

26
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.970
This recipe so fast,

27
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.310
you might as well call it a got dang, but faster.

28
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.143
First, in a large bowl,

29
00:00:57.143 --> 00:00:58.309
combine one cup, 240 grams
(cash register dings)

30
00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:59.460
of full fat yogurt,

31
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.170
two teaspoons or six grams of kosher salt,

32
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.130
1 1/4 tablespoon
(cash register dings)

33
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.600
or 11 grams of garam masala.

34
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.352
Oh, it's a fancy spice, Josh, eh.

35
00:01:05.352 --> 00:01:07.409
Look, it encapsulates all the spices you need,

36
00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.140
'cause then you don't have to buy like 4, 5, 6,

37
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.400
however many spices you need.
(spices bleep)

38
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.840
One teaspoon or three grams of paprika,

39
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.520
five cloves of garlic, finely chopped,

40
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.170
two inch knob of fresh ginger, grated.

41
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.970
Mix all it together until thoroughly combined.

42
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:18.803
Then cut two pounds
(cash register dings)

43
00:01:18.803 --> 00:01:21.120
or 900 grams of boneless and skinless chicken thighs.

44
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.185
Pause, look we all know chicken thighs are the

45
00:01:23.185 --> 00:01:24.870
superior choice here, right?
(ethereal electronic music)

46
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.310
First off, it's cheaper than the breast.

47
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.240
Second off, yeah,
(upbeat electronic music)

48
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.650
sure, use breast.

49
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.510
But I'm sick of being overjoyed

50
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.000
with a delightfully flavorful sauce only to bite

51
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.833
into a piece
(Josh chomps)

52
00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:35.850
of compressed wood sawdust
(wood scratches and jingles)

53
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.500
like overcooked chicken breast.

54
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.790
The thigh will save you from that.

55
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.623
So please use it

56
00:01:39.623 --> 00:01:42.450
and enjoy the juicy tenderness and thank me later.

57
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.410
Anyway, mix all that together

58
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.450
and allow to sit for 10 minutes at room temp,

59
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.190
but ideally overnight in the fridge.

60
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.720
Now get yourself a large saute pan

61
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.335
or some sort of a large and deep skillet.

62
00:01:50.335 --> 00:01:51.810
You could also use a small pot.

63
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.120
Look, this is the only cooking vessel you need to use here.

64
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.220
So you know, be kind of choosy, but it's fine.

65
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.270
Add just enough vegetable oil
(cash register dings)

66
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.260
to coat the bottom of the pan.

67
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.150
Heat over medium high until nearly smoking.

68
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.650
Then add all your chicken in batches

69
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.670
and sear for two to three minutes

70
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.350
per side so you get some nice browning.

71
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.183
Don't get all like, "Oh,

72
00:02:05.183 --> 00:02:06.270
"gotta cook the chicken all the way through."

73
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.230
It's gonna get cooked later.

74
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.970
So once everything's seared, remove all your chicken.

75
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.200
Add a touch more oil if needed.

76
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.100
Lower the heat to medium.

77
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.680
Add a mix of one large yellow onion, sliced,

78
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.480
a 2" knob of ginger, thinly sliced,

79
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.313
three cloves of garlic,
(cash register dings)

80
00:02:16.313 --> 00:02:17.310
also thinly sliced,

81
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.150
Seasoned lightly with salt

82
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.310
to draw that water out, it's gonna help it cook faster,

83
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.750
and saute for three to five minutes

84
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.580
or until all the vegetables are softened.

85
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.530
Then add in one teaspoon or three grams of paprika,

86
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.270
one teaspoon or three grams of cayenne powder,

87
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.980
one tablespoon or nine grams of garam masala,

88
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.840
two teaspoons or nine grams of granulated sugar,

89
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.875
and saute until so fragrant you can barely

90
00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:34.860
just got dang help yourself.

91
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.700
Then add a 15 ounce
(cash register dings)

92
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.310
or 425 gram can of crushed tomatoes.

93
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.660
Stir that together and let it reduce

94
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.493
for five minutes.
(bubble pops)

95
00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:42.060
And this next step is optional.

96
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.950
I don't wanna see you in the comments complaining, oh,

97
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.060
you don't have a blender.

98
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.070
Look, you'll literally be fine if you don't have one.

99
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.330
Just don't blend it anyway.
(text slaps)

100
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.340
Once reduced and all your vegetables are super soft,

101
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.720
pour all that into a blender and blend

102
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.480
on high speed until as smooth as physically possible.

103
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.620
Then place it back into the pan

104
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.940
or pot or whatever the hell you're using.

105
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.870
Bring it back to a simmer.

106
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.800
Reduce the heat to low.

107
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.390
Add all of your cooked chicken and simmer,

108
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.650
stirring occasionally for 10 minutes

109
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.450
or until the chicken's cooked beautifully.

110
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.220
Then stir in one cup, 240 milliliters

111
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.180
of heavy whipping cream,

112
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.500
and reduce for seven to eight more minutes,

113
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.300
stirring occasionally or until thickened.

114
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.680
There's no other way to describe this

115
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.180
other than voluptuous.

116
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.320
Now, seasoned taste with salt

117
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.610
as needed and serve next

118
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.390
to a nice big old chonker of plain steamed rice.

119
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.860
Optionally, you can garnish with cilantro,

120
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.180
but really you don't need the expenditure

121
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.013
if you don't want to.

122
00:03:22.013 --> 00:03:23.280
And look, I'll be honest, this looks beautiful,

123
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.660
but I did have to remove a couple

124
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.800
of things that I'd usually put

125
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.820
in here to keep the cost down,

126
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.110
'cause it but cheaper.
(text sparkles)

127
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.250
That's why we use garam masala.

128
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.810
It has the majority of the flavors that you need,

129
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.070
but if you want it even better,

130
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.390
and you happen to have it on hand,

131
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.070
then I would suggest adding one teaspoon

132
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.450
of ground cumin to the spice mix.

133
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.400
But again, only if you have it on hand.

134
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.660
That being said, can this still taste

135
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.810
as good despite that for the sake of our wallets?

136
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.643
Let's find out.

137
00:03:43.643 --> 00:03:45.240
So we have chicken tikka masala

138
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.010
for this price right here.
(cash register dings)

139
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.163
Let's just taste the damn thing.

140
00:03:49.163 --> 00:03:50.100
(metal clangs)

141
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.480
Woo, wow, this is great.

142
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.500
This is equally as good

143
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.060
as our other chicken tikka masala recipe.

144
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.290
I almost don't want to say it,

145
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.210
'cause all the people are like, yeah, cost benefit.

146
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.890
I'm never gonna make the other one again,

147
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.840
but this one is just as good.
(metal clangs)

148
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.210
Even with the reduction in spices, you get that strong,

149
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.550
deeply flavored spice right to the mouth.

150
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.900
It's creamy, but not too creamy.

151
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.900
Mostly tomato-y, a little bit tart, a little bit spicy,

152
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.970
and you got that umami from the chicken fat.

153
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.350
If I ordered this chicken tikka masala

154
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.820
and they gave it to me for $17,

155
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.653
I'd be like, "Okay,

156
00:04:15.653 --> 00:04:16.486
"but it was only this."
(cash register dings)

157
00:04:16.486 --> 00:04:19.149
But you wanna know what else is cheaper, B-roll.

158
00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:22.649
(upbeat electronic music)
