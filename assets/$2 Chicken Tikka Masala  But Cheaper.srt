1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,923
- Normally when we order

2
00:00:00,923 --> 00:00:02,100
chicken tikka masala, bing
(cash register chimes)

3
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,660
but we don't worry about
it 'cause it's tastes good.

4
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,890
But you can have it possibly better

5
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,651
for this that is much cheaper.
(cash register chimes)

6
00:00:06,651 --> 00:00:08,238
(upbeat electronic music)

7
00:00:08,238 --> 00:00:10,906
(slots jingle)

8
00:00:10,906 --> 00:00:13,406
(coins clink)

9
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:26,762
So I've been feeling
(gentle piano music)

10
00:00:26,762 --> 00:00:27,900
this is gonna be a bit of a challenge,

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,510
because this is a heavy spice recipe,

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,770
and spices kind of jack

13
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,603
up the price of things.
(money sack thumps)

14
00:00:32,603 --> 00:00:34,290
So not everybody has a spice on hands,

15
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,130
they gotta go buy one,

16
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,470
and then we're gonna factor
in the whole bottle, ow.

17
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,820
So we're gonna have to delete spices

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,840
and somehow configure

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,400
and mechanize this
(equations bleep)

20
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,950
into a fully functioning robot of flavor.

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,290
I don't know why I'm using mechanization

22
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,180
and robotics to describe this,

23
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,140
but I know that we can do it.

24
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,460
We've never backed down from a challenge.

25
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,070
So with all that being said,
let's make this, shall we?

26
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,970
This recipe so fast,

27
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,310
you might as well call it
a got dang, but faster.

28
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,143
First, in a large bowl,

29
00:00:57,143 --> 00:00:58,309
combine one cup, 240 grams
(cash register dings)

30
00:00:58,309 --> 00:00:59,460
of full fat yogurt,

31
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,170
two teaspoons or six grams of kosher salt,

32
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,130
1 1/4 tablespoon
(cash register dings)

33
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,600
or 11 grams of garam masala.

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,352
Oh, it's a fancy spice, Josh, eh.

35
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:07,409
Look, it encapsulates
all the spices you need,

36
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,140
'cause then you don't
have to buy like 4, 5, 6,

37
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,400
however many spices you need.
(spices bleep)

38
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,840
One teaspoon or three grams of paprika,

39
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,520
five cloves of garlic, finely chopped,

40
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,170
two inch knob of fresh ginger, grated.

41
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,970
Mix all it together until
thoroughly combined.

42
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:18,803
Then cut two pounds
(cash register dings)

43
00:01:18,803 --> 00:01:21,120
or 900 grams of boneless
and skinless chicken thighs.

44
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,185
Pause, look we all know
chicken thighs are the

45
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:24,870
superior choice here, right?
(ethereal electronic music)

46
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,310
First off, it's cheaper than the breast.

47
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,240
Second off, yeah,
(upbeat electronic music)

48
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,650
sure, use breast.

49
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,510
But I'm sick of being overjoyed

50
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,000
with a delightfully
flavorful sauce only to bite

51
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,833
into a piece
(Josh chomps)

52
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,850
of compressed wood sawdust
(wood scratches and jingles)

53
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,500
like overcooked chicken breast.

54
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,790
The thigh will save you from that.

55
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,623
So please use it

56
00:01:39,623 --> 00:01:42,450
and enjoy the juicy
tenderness and thank me later.

57
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,410
Anyway, mix all that together

58
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,450
and allow to sit for 10
minutes at room temp,

59
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,190
but ideally overnight in the fridge.

60
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,720
Now get yourself a large saute pan

61
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,335
or some sort of a large and deep skillet.

62
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:51,810
You could also use a small pot.

63
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,120
Look, this is the only cooking
vessel you need to use here.

64
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,220
So you know, be kind of
choosy, but it's fine.

65
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,270
Add just enough vegetable oil
(cash register dings)

66
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,260
to coat the bottom of the pan.

67
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,150
Heat over medium high
until nearly smoking.

68
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,650
Then add all your chicken in batches

69
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,670
and sear for two to three minutes

70
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,350
per side so you get some nice browning.

71
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,183
Don't get all like, "Oh,

72
00:02:05,183 --> 00:02:06,270
"gotta cook the chicken
all the way through."

73
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,230
It's gonna get cooked later.

74
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,970
So once everything's seared,
remove all your chicken.

75
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,200
Add a touch more oil if needed.

76
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,100
Lower the heat to medium.

77
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,680
Add a mix of one large
yellow onion, sliced,

78
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,480
a 2" knob of ginger, thinly sliced,

79
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,313
three cloves of garlic,
(cash register dings)

80
00:02:16,313 --> 00:02:17,310
also thinly sliced,

81
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,150
Seasoned lightly with salt

82
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,310
to draw that water out, it's
gonna help it cook faster,

83
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,750
and saute for three to five minutes

84
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,580
or until all the vegetables are softened.

85
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,530
Then add in one teaspoon
or three grams of paprika,

86
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,270
one teaspoon or three
grams of cayenne powder,

87
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,980
one tablespoon or nine
grams of garam masala,

88
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,840
two teaspoons or nine
grams of granulated sugar,

89
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,875
and saute until so fragrant you can barely

90
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,860
just got dang help yourself.

91
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,700
Then add a 15 ounce
(cash register dings)

92
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,310
or 425 gram can of crushed tomatoes.

93
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,660
Stir that together and let it reduce

94
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,493
for five minutes.
(bubble pops)

95
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,060
And this next step is optional.

96
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,950
I don't wanna see you in the
comments complaining, oh,

97
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,060
you don't have a blender.

98
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,070
Look, you'll literally be
fine if you don't have one.

99
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,330
Just don't blend it anyway.
(text slaps)

100
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,340
Once reduced and all your
vegetables are super soft,

101
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,720
pour all that into a blender and blend

102
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,480
on high speed until as smooth
as physically possible.

103
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,620
Then place it back into the pan

104
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,940
or pot or whatever the hell you're using.

105
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,870
Bring it back to a simmer.

106
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,800
Reduce the heat to low.

107
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,390
Add all of your cooked chicken and simmer,

108
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,650
stirring occasionally for 10 minutes

109
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,450
or until the chicken's cooked beautifully.

110
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,220
Then stir in one cup, 240 milliliters

111
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,180
of heavy whipping cream,

112
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,500
and reduce for seven
to eight more minutes,

113
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,300
stirring occasionally or until thickened.

114
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,680
There's no other way to describe this

115
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,180
other than voluptuous.

116
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,320
Now, seasoned taste with salt

117
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,610
as needed and serve next

118
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,390
to a nice big old chonker
of plain steamed rice.

119
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,860
Optionally, you can garnish with cilantro,

120
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,180
but really you don't need the expenditure

121
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,013
if you don't want to.

122
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:23,280
And look, I'll be honest,
this looks beautiful,

123
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,660
but I did have to remove a couple

124
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,800
of things that I'd usually put

125
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,820
in here to keep the cost down,

126
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,110
'cause it but cheaper.
(text sparkles)

127
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,250
That's why we use garam masala.

128
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,810
It has the majority of
the flavors that you need,

129
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,070
but if you want it even better,

130
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,390
and you happen to have it on hand,

131
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,070
then I would suggest adding one teaspoon

132
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,450
of ground cumin to the spice mix.

133
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,400
But again, only if you have it on hand.

134
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,660
That being said, can this still taste

135
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,810
as good despite that for
the sake of our wallets?

136
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,643
Let's find out.

137
00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:45,240
So we have chicken tikka masala

138
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,010
for this price right here.
(cash register dings)

139
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,163
Let's just taste the damn thing.

140
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:50,100
(metal clangs)

141
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,480
Woo, wow, this is great.

142
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,500
This is equally as good

143
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,060
as our other chicken tikka masala recipe.

144
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,290
I almost don't want to say it,

145
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,210
'cause all the people are
like, yeah, cost benefit.

146
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,890
I'm never gonna make the other one again,

147
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,840
but this one is just as good.
(metal clangs)

148
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,210
Even with the reduction in
spices, you get that strong,

149
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,550
deeply flavored spice right to the mouth.

150
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,900
It's creamy, but not too creamy.

151
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,900
Mostly tomato-y, a little
bit tart, a little bit spicy,

152
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,970
and you got that umami
from the chicken fat.

153
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,350
If I ordered this chicken tikka masala

154
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,820
and they gave it to me for $17,

155
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,653
I'd be like, "Okay,

156
00:04:15,653 --> 00:04:16,486
"but it was only this."
(cash register dings)

157
00:04:16,486 --> 00:04:19,149
But you wanna know what
else is cheaper, B-roll.

158
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:22,649
